Current stay neighborhood has  great amenities  Such as gourmet fast food joints, pharmacies, parks, grad schools, and so on. Got a new Job offer from a great company and have to move to on the other side of the city with great career prospects. However, given the far distance from the current place, you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer. Wouldn't it be great if you're able to determine neighborhoods on the other  side of the city?  are there exactly the same as current neighborhood, and if not, perhaps similar neighborhoods that are at least closer to the new job. So what is possibalities of options available ? ...Hence the name battle of the neighborhoods.
